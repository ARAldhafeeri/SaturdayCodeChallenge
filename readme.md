# Saturday code challenge
every Saturday we will have a code challenge. The code challenge will be simple and will touch on important topics in backend development. Every challenge will have two main parts:
1. A simple design document that describes the challenge in which you can read and implement by yourself.
2. A simple implementation of the challenge under the `solution` directory.
